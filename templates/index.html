			    			<p>I am a husband, runner, friend of all dogs, programmer, teacher, and entrepreneur. </p><br>
			    			<p>I like to learn and build with technology.</p><br>
					    	<p>I am a founder of multiple businesses, all of which leverage the Python programming language. From using Flask web development on all of my business sites, to Scikit-Learn and Pandas for machine learning and data analysis with <a href="//ensmo.com" target="blank"><strong>Ensmo.com</strong></a>, to the Natural Language Toolkit for natural language processing with <a href="http://sentdex.com" target="blank"><strong>Sentdex.com</strong></a>, to teaching a massive variety of Python programming topics on <a href="//pythonprogramming.net" target="blank"><strong>PythonProgramming.net</strong></a>, Python and programming is a major part of my life and work.</p><br>
					    	<p>I believe programming is a super power, and the social impact of making this education easily accessible to anyone is one of the most important things I can do with my life.</p><br>

									<p>Programming has become a major part of my life, and has allowed me to continue my pursuit of entrepreneurship. It is my hope to pass along the super power of programming to others. PythonProgramming.net hosts about a thousand Python programming tutorials on a wide variety of topics like <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/web-development-tutorials/" target="blank"><strong>Web Development</strong></a>, <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/data-analysis-tutorials/" target="blank"><strong>Data Analysis</strong></a>, <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/robotics-tutorials/" target="blank"><strong>Robotics</strong></a>, <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/game-development-tutorials/" target="blank"><strong>Game Development</strong></a>, <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/finance-tutorials/" target="blank"><strong>Finance</strong></a>, <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorials/" target="blank"><strong>Machine Learning</strong></a>, and a whole bunch of others.</p>

									<p>The largest project here has been via <a href="https://psyber.io/" target="blank"><strong>Psyber.io</strong></a> and <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/game-frames-open-cv-python-plays-gta-v/" target="blank"><strong>PythonProgramming.net</strong></a> to get a deep-learning agent to learn to play games. This mainly has been centered around Grand Theft Auto V, but has been in other game environments such as <a href="https://halite.io/" target="blank"><strong>Halite</strong></a>, where our AI, "Charles," was the #1 ranked machine learning bot (Halite 2017 competition).</p>

									<p>The "Charles" AI in Grand Theft Auto V mainly drove cars, but later it was also taught to steal cars, drive/fire tanks, and chat with viewers of the Twitch stream.</p>

									<p>Charles the AI is on <a href="https://twitter.com/Charles_the_AI" target="blank"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> as well as talking to people on our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/3jCqXJj" target="blank"><strong>Discord</strong></a> server.</p>

Here, I track sentiment analysis for a variety of topics, including stocks, politicians, political topics, and general geographic sentiment which is plotted on a globe.</p>

			    			<p>Due to the volume of emails I receive, please try keep things short. A massive block of text is likely to get passed over. I try to respond as soon as I open an email, otherwise I forget to do it. If I open a massive email, I wont have time to respond, and then I will probably forget about it later. If you send the same email to multiple email addresses of mine, I will ignore them. If I don't respond within 72 hours, you might want to send again, so long as you've noted the information below.</p><br>

												      <p>My rate is $250/hr. I do not accept equity or debt.<br><br>

												      Send me the specs of what you're looking for, and I will tell you if I can do it, how long it will take, and how much it will cost. I require half payment up front, and the other half upon completion.<br><br>

												      If you need me to help you spec it out, this is a form of consulting and I will require payment for this, including payment upfront for this stage.<br><br>

												      The rate is not negotiable, and is simply a function of supply and demand. If you're not sure about what I can do, check <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/" target="blank"><strong>PythonProgramming.net</strong></a>, which is my tutorials website that shows what I know. You may even find that you can learn to do it yourself!</p>

												      <p>I rarely accept these, usually due to an unfavorable contract.<br><br>
												      I already have my own distribution network, so I am often better off producing for myself than for a publisher and taking 12-25% royalties. Despite this, I have done both books and educational videos for a variety of producers.<br><br>
												      I do not take less than a 20% royalty if I am the main content creator, which is usually the deal breaker. I am aware of how few technical books are typically sold.<br><br>
												      I care more about a fair contract than how much you claim I stand to make in dollars on your platform.<br><br>
												      I require an advance that amounts to $1,000/hr of content, whether that is in video or text form.</p>
